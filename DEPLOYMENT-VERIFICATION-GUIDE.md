# Auto AGI Builder Production Deployment Verification Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines how to verify that your Auto AGI Builder deployment is working correctly in production. Based on your feedback that the application "is already set to production," this guide focuses on verifying the existing production deployment rather than creating a new one.

## 1. Frontend Verification

### Accessibility Check
- Visit the production URL in an incognito/private window
- Verify the site loads without login prompts
- Check that public pages are accessible without authentication

### Visual Verification
- Verify all visual components render correctly:
  - Home page banner and call-to-action buttons
  - Feature sections with 3D shadow effects
  - Navigation components
  - Responsive design on mobile sizes

### User Flow Testing
- Test key user journeys:
  - Landing page → Feature exploration
  - Requirements gathering flow
  - Prototype generation process
  - ROI calculation workflow

## 2. Backend API Verification

### API Endpoint Status
- Test core API endpoints:
  ```
  curl -X GET https://api-auto-agi-builder.vercel.app/api/health
  curl -X GET https://api-auto-agi-builder.vercel.app/api/v1/status
  ```

### API Authentication
- Test if authentication is correctly bypassed or handled:
  ```
  curl -X GET https://api-auto-agi-builder.vercel.app/api/v1/requirements
  ```

### API Performance
- Check response times from key endpoints
- Verify payload sizes are reasonable

## 3. Integration Verification

### Frontend-Backend Communication
- Monitor network requests in browser developer tools
- Verify that frontend API calls to the backend succeed
- Check for CORS-related errors in the console

### Storage Service Integration
- Test file upload functionality (if applicable)
- Verify uploaded assets are accessible

### Database Integration
- Test data persistence across page loads
- Verify data retrieval operations

## 4. Common Production Issues & Solutions

### 401/403 Authentication Errors
If still encountering authentication errors:

1. Check Vercel team project settings:
   - Ensure project visibility is set to "Public"
   - Verify authentication is explicitly disabled

2. Review vercel.json configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "version": 2,
     "public": true,
     "rewrites": [
       { "source": "/api/(.*)", "destination": "https://api-auto-agi-builder.vercel.app/api/$1" },
       { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
     ],
     "github": {
       "enabled": false,
       "silent": true
     }
   }
   ```

3. Check frontend environment variables:
   - Ensure `DISABLE_AUTH=true` is set in environment variables

### CORS Issues
If browser console shows CORS errors:

1. Verify backend CORS configuration includes frontend domain:
   ```python
   app.add_middleware(
       CORSMiddleware,
       allow_origins=["https://auto-agi-landing.vercel.app", "https://auto-agi-builder.com"],
       allow_credentials=True,
       allow_methods=["*"],
       allow_headers=["*"],
   )
   ```

2. Test with temporary wider CORS settings:
   ```python
   app.add_middleware(
       CORSMiddleware,
       allow_origins=["*"],
       allow_credentials=True,
       allow_methods=["*"],
       allow_headers=["*"],
   )
   ```

### SPA Routing Issues
If getting 404s on direct navigation to routes:

1. Verify your "rewrites" in vercel.json is correctly configured:
   ```json
   "rewrites": [
     { "source": "/api/(.*)", "destination": "https://api-auto-agi-builder.vercel.app/api/$1" },
     { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
   ]
   ```

### Asset Loading Issues
If resources fail to load:

1. Check for mixed content warnings (HTTP vs HTTPS)
2. Verify asset paths are using correct production URLs
3. Check CDN configuration if using a content delivery network

## 5. Post-Verification Steps

### Monitoring Setup
- Set up uptime monitoring for key endpoints
- Configure error alerting for critical paths
- Implement logging for important operations

### Performance Optimization
- Run Lighthouse/PageSpeed tests to identify performance issues
- Optimize image sizes and implement lazy loading
- Add appropriate caching headers

### Security Assessment
- Verify SSL/TLS configuration
- Check for exposed environment variables
- Review authentication mechanisms

## 6. Custom Domain Configuration

If using a custom domain:

1. Verify DNS configuration:
   - Frontend: `yourdomain.com` → Vercel frontend
   - API: `api.yourdomain.com` → Vercel backend

2. Confirm SSL/TLS certificates are active and valid for both domains

3. Update CORS settings with custom domain

4. Test accessibility via custom domains

## 7. Rollback Readiness

Keep the `rollback-deployment.bat` script ready in case you need to revert to a previous working version:

- Ensure team members know how to execute the rollback procedure
- Document the current working deployment for future reference

## Next Steps for Enhancing Production Deployment

1. **Analytics Implementation**
   - Set up user behavior tracking
   - Configure conversion goals
   - Track feature usage

2. **Advanced Monitoring**
   - Implement real-user monitoring
   - Set up synthetic transaction testing
   - Configure log aggregation and analysis

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement code splitting
   - Optimize API response payloads
   - Enhance caching strategies

4. **Scaling Preparation**
   - Document scaling thresholds
   - Plan for horizontal scaling
   - Implement database query optimization
