## Launch Sequence

Follow this ordered sequence to launch the application to production:

### 1. Final Infrastructure Preparation (T-7 days)

1. Create production database and perform initial schema migration
   ```bash
   # Create production database backup in case of rollback
   pg_dump -U postgres -d auto_agi_builder_staging > pre_launch_backup.sql
   
   # Run migrations on production
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

2. Verify all environment variables are configured in:
   - Backend environment file
   - Vercel project settings
   - CI/CD pipelines

3. Test CDN asset delivery and storage access

### 2. Pre-Production Deployment (T-5 days)

1. Deploy backend to staging environment
   ```bash
   # Deploy via Docker
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
   ```

2. Deploy frontend to Vercel preview environment
   ```bash
   # Push to deployment branch
   git push origin staging
   ```

3. Configure monitoring and alerting (see [Monitoring and Analytics Guide](monitoring_and_analytics.md))

### 3. Final Testing (T-3 days)

1. Execute complete end-to-end test suite
   ```bash
   # Run full test suite
   python launch_preparation/technical_finalization/end_to_end_tests.py --environment staging
   ```

2. Perform load testing
   ```bash
   # Run load tests
   python launch_preparation/technical_finalization/load_testing.py --concurrent-users 100 --duration 600
   ```

3. Execute cross-browser and cross-device testing (see [Testing and Verification Guide](testing_and_verification.md))

4. Verify all third-party integrations including:
   - Payment processing
   - Email delivery
   - Authentication providers
   - External APIs

### 4. Production Deployment (T-1 day)

1. Create final database backup
   ```bash
   # Create final pre-launch backup
   pg_dump -U postgres -d auto_agi_builder_production > final_pre_launch_backup.sql
   ```

2. Deploy backend to production environment
   ```bash
   # Deploy to production
   ./deploy_to_production.sh
   ```

3. Deploy frontend to Vercel production environment
   ```bash
   # Merge to main and deploy
   git checkout main
   git merge staging
   git push origin main
   ```

4. Verify deployment
   ```bash
   # Run verification tests
   python launch_preparation/launch_readiness_assessment.py --production
   ```

### 5. Launch (T-0)

1. Run final connectivity checks
   ```bash
   # Verify all endpoints are accessible
   python scripts/verify_endpoints.py --environment production
   ```

2. Configure DNS records to direct traffic to production servers

3. Activate monitoring and alerting systems

4. Distribute launch announcement

## Post-Launch Tasks

After launch, immediately perform these tasks to ensure everything is running smoothly:

1. **Monitor System Performance**
   - Review Grafana dashboards
   - Watch for any error spikes
   - Monitor database performance

2. **User Journey Verification**
   - Create a new account
   - Test sign-up flow
   - Verify email deliverability
   - Complete onboarding process
   - Test subscription functionality

3. **Analytics Validation**
   - Confirm analytics are collecting data
   - Verify user tracking is working
   - Check conversion points are properly tracked

4. **Backup Verification**
   - Verify automated backups are running
   - Test a sample recovery process

## Emergency Procedures

In case of critical issues after launch:

### Frontend Issues

1. Rollback to previous version in Vercel dashboard
2. Notify users of maintenance if necessary

### Backend Issues

1. Execute rollback procedure:
   ```bash
   # Rollback to previous version
   ./rollback.sh --version previous
   ```

2. If database issues:
   ```bash
   # Restore from backup
   pg_restore -U postgres -d auto_agi_builder_production final_pre_launch_backup.sql
   ```

### Communication Procedure

1. Update status page
2. Send notification to internal team
3. Prepare user communication if downtime exceeds 10 minutes
