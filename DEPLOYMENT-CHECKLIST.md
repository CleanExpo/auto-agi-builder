# Auto AGI Builder Deployment Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive checklist for deploying the Auto AGI Builder project with the context compression tools integrated into the deployment pipeline. It tracks completed items and items that still need to be addressed.

## 1. Components of the Deployment System

### Unified Deployment Script
- [x] Created `unified-deploy.js` for handling the entire deployment process
- [x] Created `unified-deploy.bat` for Windows environments
- [x] Created `unified-deploy.ps1` for PowerShell environments
- [ ] Add direct integration with context compression in unified deployment scripts

### Deployment Verification Script
- [x] Created `scripts/verify-deployment.js` for comprehensive checks
- [x] Created `verify-deployment.bat` for Windows environments
- [x] Created `verify-deployment.ps1` for PowerShell environments
- [ ] Add verification of compressed resources

### Context Compression Integration
- [x] Created `middle-out-compress.js` core compression algorithm
- [x] Created `compress-auto-agi.js` for project-specific implementation
- [x] Created `compression-config.js` for environment-specific settings
- [x] Created `deployment-compress.js` for deployment integration
- [x] Created `deploy-compress.bat` for user-friendly execution
- [ ] Create PowerShell equivalent `deploy-compress.ps1`

## 2. Prerequisites

### Node.js Environment
- [x] Verified compatibility with Node.js v16.x or later
- [x] Added Node.js version check in deployment scripts
- [ ] Document Node.js minimum requirements in project README

### Version Control
- [x] Git integration for deployment tracking
- [x] Deploy from main branch only
- [ ] Add Git branch verification to prevent deployment from development branches

### Vercel Configuration
- [x] Created and configured `vercel.json`
- [x] Set up Vercel CLI installation check in deployment scripts
- [ ] Update Vercel configuration to handle compressed files

### Environment Configuration
- [x] Set up environment variables for different deployment targets
- [x] Created environment-specific compression settings
- [ ] Create environment validation to ensure all required variables are set

## 3. Deployment Process

### Preparation
- [x] Check prerequisites step
- [x] Validate and update configuration files
- [x] Add compression step in the process
- [ ] Add automated testing before deployment

### Build Process
- [x] Frontend build step
- [ ] Optimize build step with compression
- [ ] Add progress indicators for large builds

### Deployment
- [x] Deploy to Vercel (preview or production)
- [x] Integrate compression with deployment
- [ ] Add rollback capability if deployment fails

### Post-Deployment
- [x] Basic deployment verification
- [x] Log deployment results
- [ ] Add notifications for successful/failed deployments

## 4. Verifying Your Deployment

### Automated Verification
- [x] Basic access verification
- [x] Critical paths verification
- [x] API endpoints verification
- [x] Security headers verification
- [x] Performance metrics verification
- [ ] Add compressed files verification
- [ ] Add load testing for performance under stress

### Manual Verification
- [x] Access testing
- [ ] Create checklist for manual testing
- [ ] Add visual regression testing

### Reporting
- [x] Generate verification report
- [x] Save verification results to log file
- [ ] Add integration with monitoring systems

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Documentation
- [x] Documented common deployment failures
- [x] Documented authentication issues
- [x] Documented build failures
- [x] Documented configuration issues
- [ ] Document compression-related issues and mitigation

### Recovery Procedures
- [ ] Create step-by-step recovery procedures for each failure scenario
- [ ] Create automated recovery scripts where possible

## 6. CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions
- [x] Created example GitHub workflow
- [ ] Implement full CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Add compression step to CI/CD pipeline

### Environment Variables
- [x] Documented required environment variables
- [ ] Set up secure storage of environment variables in CI/CD

### Automated Testing
- [ ] Implement unit testing in CI/CD
- [ ] Implement integration testing in CI/CD
- [ ] Add performance testing to CI/CD pipeline

## 7. Best Practices

### Regular Deployments
- [x] Documented need for regular deployments
- [ ] Set up scheduled deployments for security updates

### Staged Deployments
- [x] Documented staged deployment approach
- [ ] Configure promotion between environments

### Automated Testing
- [x] Documented requirement for tests before deployment
- [ ] Implement comprehensive test suite

### Environment Variable Management
- [x] Documented environment variable best practices
- [ ] Create environment variable templates

### Monitoring
- [x] Suggested monitoring solutions
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for compressed files

### Rollback Plan
- [x] Documented need for rollback plan
- [ ] Implement automated rollback procedure

## Next Steps and Implementation Plan

### Immediate (Next 1-2 Weeks)
1. Create `deploy-compress.ps1` for PowerShell users
2. Update Vercel configuration for compressed files
3. Document compression-related troubleshooting
4. Update unified deployment scripts to directly integrate compression

### Short-term (1-2 Months)
1. Implement full CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions 
2. Add automated testing to deployment pipeline
3. Create automated rollback procedure
4. Implement monitoring and alerting

### Long-term (3-6 Months)
1. Add performance testing to CI/CD pipeline
2. Implement visual regression testing
3. Create automated recovery scripts
4. Set up scheduled deployments for security updates
