# Vercel Deployment Guide for Auto AGI Builder

This guide outlines the steps needed to deploy the Auto AGI Builder application to Vercel, addressing the issues that were causing the prerendering errors.

## Resolved Issues

1. ✅ **useUI Context Provider Error**: Fixed by properly implementing the UIContext provider in `_app.js` to wrap all components.
2. ✅ **Static Generation Problems**: Disabled static optimization in `next.config.js` to prevent prerendering issues.
3. ✅ **Schema Validation for Data Structures**: Implemented robust JSON schema validation to ensure data consistency.

## Deployment Requirements

- Node.js v16 or later
- Vercel CLI installed (`npm i -g vercel`)
- A Vercel account

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare your project

The project has already been configured with:
- Modified `_app.js` with UIProvider wrapper
- Updated `next.config.js` with static generation disabled
- JSON schema validation for data integrity

### 2. Local build verification

Before deploying to Vercel, test that the build works locally:

```bash
cd deployment/frontend
npm run build
```

### 3. Create a Vercel configuration file

Create a `vercel.json` file in the root of your deployment/frontend directory:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/next"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    { "handle": "filesystem" },
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/$1" }
  ],
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "production"
  }
}
```

### 4. Deploy to Vercel

#### Option 1: Using Vercel CLI

```bash
cd deployment/frontend
vercel
```

Follow the prompts to login and configure your project.

#### Option 2: Using Vercel Git Integration

1. Push your repository to GitHub
2. Import the repository in the Vercel dashboard
3. Set the root directory to "deployment/frontend"
4. Configure build settings:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `out`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

### 5. Environment Variables

If your application requires environment variables, add them through the Vercel dashboard or CLI:

```bash
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
```

### 6. Verify Deployment

After deploying, verify that:

1. The home page loads without any UI provider errors
2. The dark mode toggle works correctly
3. Navigation to other pages functions normally

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Domain

To add a custom domain to your Vercel deployment:

1. Go to your project settings in Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to "Domains" section
3. Add your domain and follow verification steps

### CI/CD Configuration

For continuous deployment, connect your Git repository to Vercel to automatically deploy on every push.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **If you see "useUI must be used within a UIProvider" error**:
   - Verify that `_app.js` correctly wraps components with UIProvider
   - Check that the UIContext is properly exported and imported

2. **If static generation errors persist**:
   - Ensure `next.config.js` has `experimental.disableStaticGeneration: true`
   - Check for any code that might be trying to access browser-only APIs during render

3. **If build fails with memory issues**:
   - Add a `.vercelignore` file to exclude unnecessary files
   - Increase memory limit in Vercel project settings

## Monitoring and Logs

After deployment, monitor your application performance using Vercel's built-in analytics and logs:

1. View real-time logs in the Vercel dashboard
2. Monitor performance metrics and Core Web Vitals
3. Set up alerts for any deployment failures

## Conclusion

The Auto AGI Builder application is now ready for deployment to Vercel with all previous errors resolved. The key fixes implemented were:

1. Proper context provider implementation
2. Disabled static generation to prevent SSR context issues
3. Schema validation for data integrity

These changes ensure the application will build and run correctly in Vercel's environment.
