# Converting Auto AGI Builder from Development to Production

This guide will walk you through the process of migrating your Auto AGI Builder from development environment to production using Vercel. Follow these steps carefully to ensure a smooth transition.

## Understanding Environment Differences

### Development Environment
- Local environment with development-specific features enabled
- Often uses local API endpoints and services
- Debug information and development tools are enabled
- Less focus on optimization and security

### Production Environment
- Public-facing environment optimized for end users
- Uses production API endpoints and services
- Performance optimized, no debugging information
- Enhanced security measures and error handling
- Custom domain setup with SSL

## Step 1: Configure Production Environment Variables

The first step is to set up your production environment variables:

1. Your existing `finalize-vercel-deployment.js` script creates these environment variables for production:
   ```
   VERCEL_PROJECT_ID="prj_7uKXTp60gosR1DMXBpOaI0hTyPEO"
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT="production"
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="https://api.autoagibuilder.com"
   DISABLE_STATIC_GENERATION=true
   ```

2. If you need to add more environment variables, add them to your Vercel project settings:
   - Log in to your Vercel account
   - Select your Auto AGI Builder project
   - Go to "Settings" → "Environment Variables"
   - Add variables such as:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_DOMAIN` (if you're using authentication)
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_CLIENT_ID` (if you're using authentication)
     - Any database connection strings (ensure these are marked as "Production" only)

## Step 2: Prepare Your Code for Production

1. **Optimize Builds**: Ensure your `next.config.js` has the proper production settings:
   - `disableStaticGeneration: true` (already set by your script)
   - Consider enabling other optimizations like image optimization

2. **Error Handling**: Make sure all components have proper error boundaries for production
   - Your existing ErrorBoundary component in `deployment/frontend/components/common/ErrorBoundary.js`

3. **Logging**: Configure proper logging for production
   - Consider using the Vercel logging integration

## Step 3: Run the Production Deployment Setup Script

Your existing `finalize-vercel-deployment.js` script handles most of the production setup:

1. Navigate to your project root directory
2. Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   node deployment/finalize-vercel-deployment.js
   ```

This script will:
- Create `.env.production` with production environment variables
- Verify `next.config.js` has proper production settings
- Commit and push changes to your Git repository
- Deploy to Vercel if the CLI is installed

## Step 4: Deploy to Vercel Production Environment

If the automated deployment didn't complete, follow these manual steps:

1. **Connect to Vercel**:
   - Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
   - Create a new project or select your existing one
   - Connect to your GitHub repository

2. **Configure Deployment Settings**:
   - Framework: Next.js
   - Root Directory: `deployment/frontend`
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Add all your production environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
   - Ensure they're marked for "Production" environment only

4. **Deploy**:
   - Click "Deploy" button
   - Vercel will build and deploy your application

## Step 5: Configure Production Domain

1. **Add Custom Domain**:
   - In Vercel dashboard, go to your project
   - Navigate to "Settings" → "Domains"
   - Add your custom domain (e.g., autoagibuilder.com)

2. **Configure DNS Records**:
   - Set up DNS records for your domain as shown in the Vercel instructions:
     - CNAME record: `www → cname.vercel-dns.com.`
     - A record: `@ → 76.76.21.21`

3. **Verify SSL**:
   - Vercel automatically provisions SSL certificates
   - Ensure the SSL is properly activated and configured

## Step 6: Post-Deployment Verification

After deploying to production, it's crucial to verify everything works correctly:

1. **Test All Features**:
   - Log in/out functionality
   - User flows
   - API integrations
   - Data retrieval and storage

2. **Performance Check**:
   - Run Lighthouse audit on your production site
   - Check loading times for key pages
   - Verify that API calls are responsive

3. **Error Monitoring**:
   - Set up error monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
   - Configure alerts for critical errors

## Step 7: Set Up Continuous Deployment (Optional)

For future updates, set up continuous deployment:

1. **Configure GitHub Actions**:
   - Your `.github/workflows/vercel-deployment.yml` file handles this

2. **Set Required Secrets**:
   - VERCEL_TOKEN
   - VERCEL_ORG_ID
   - VERCEL_PROJECT_ID

3. **Test the Workflow**:
   - Make a small change to your codebase
   - Push to the main branch
   - Verify that the deployment automatically happens

## Common Production Issues and Solutions

1. **Static Generation Errors**:
   - Symptom: "useUI must be used within a UIProvider" errors
   - Solution: Ensure `disableStaticGeneration: true` is set in next.config.js

2. **API Connection Issues**:
   - Symptom: API calls fail in production
   - Solution: Verify your `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is correct and the API is accessible

3. **Authentication Problems**:
   - Symptom: Users can't log in
   - Solution: Check authentication environment variables and configurations

4. **Missing Environment Variables**:
   - Symptom: Undefined variables in the application
   - Solution: Ensure all required variables are set in Vercel dashboard

## Production Monitoring

Once in production, set up monitoring:

1. **Vercel Analytics**:
   - Enable in Vercel dashboard
   - Monitor page performance and user experience

2. **Error Tracking**:
   - Set up integration with error monitoring service
   - Configure alerts for critical issues

3. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Track Core Web Vitals
   - Monitor server response times

## Conclusion

Transitioning from development to production requires careful planning and execution. This guide covered the essential steps to deploy your Auto AGI Builder to production using Vercel. 

After following these steps, your application should be running smoothly in a production environment with proper configuration, security, and monitoring.

For ongoing maintenance, refer to the Vercel documentation and consider implementing additional production best practices specific to your application's needs.
