# SSL Certificate Generation Guide

Based on your feedback, I can see that Vercel is currently attempting to generate SSL certificates for your domains (`www.auto-agi-builder.app` and `auto-agi-builder.app`). This is a normal process when setting up custom domains in Vercel.

## Understanding SSL Certificate Generation

When you add a custom domain to Vercel, the following happens:

1. Vercel checks your DNS configuration (CNAME and A records)
2. Once verified, Vercel begins the SSL certificate generation process
3. Vercel requests certificates from Let's Encrypt (or similar authority)
4. The certificates are issued and automatically installed on your domains

## Expected Wait Time

The SSL certificate generation process can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours. This depends on:

- DNS propagation status (DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to fully propagate)
- Let's Encrypt verification and issuance processes
- Vercel's certificate deployment process

## What to Do While Waiting

While waiting for SSL certificate generation:

1. **Set up environment variables in Vercel** (critical step):
   - Use the tools we created:
     - Run `deployment/run-add-env-variables.bat` to add environment variables
     - Or follow the manual instructions in `deployment/SETUP-VERCEL-ENV-VARIABLES.md`

2. **Access your site through Vercel's default domain**:
   - Your site is already accessible at `https://auto-agi-builder.vercel.app` 
   - You can test most functionality there while waiting for your custom domain setup

3. **Monitor certificate status**:
   - Check the Vercel dashboard periodically
   - Go to Project → Settings → Domains
   - Look for a green checkmark next to your domains

## How to Verify Certificate Installation

You'll know your SSL certificates are successfully installed when:

1. **Vercel Dashboard**: Your domains show "Valid Configuration" with a green checkmark
2. **Browser**: Visiting your site shows a padlock icon in the address bar
3. **Certificate Check**: You can use online tools like [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) to verify details

## Troubleshooting SSL Certificate Issues

If certificate generation fails or takes too long:

1. **Verify DNS records**:
   - CNAME record: `www` → `cname.vercel-dns.com.`
   - A record: `@` → `76.76.21.21`

2. **Check for certificate errors**:
   - In the Vercel dashboard under Domains section
   - Look for specific error messages that might indicate the problem

3. **Refresh the certificate**:
   - Sometimes you can trigger a refresh in the Vercel dashboard
   - Click the refresh icon next to the domain if available

4. **Contact Vercel support**:
   - If issues persist beyond 24 hours, consider contacting Vercel support

## After SSL Certificates are Generated

Once certificates are successfully issued:

1. **Test your website** thoroughly at both domains:
   - `https://auto-agi-builder.app`
   - `https://www.auto-agi-builder.app`

2. **Check for mixed content warnings**:
   - Ensure all resources load over HTTPS
   - Check browser console for warnings

3. **Set up SSL renewal monitoring** (optional):
   - Vercel handles renewals automatically
   - But you can set up monitoring with tools like UptimeRobot

4. **Configure HSTS** (recommended for security):
   - Consider adding HSTS headers once everything is working

## Importance of Environment Variables

Remember that even with SSL certificates in place, your application will not function correctly without the proper environment variables. Be sure to:

1. Set up the environment variables as outlined in `deployment/SETUP-VERCEL-ENV-VARIABLES.md`
2. Redeploy your application after adding these variables
3. Test to ensure all features work correctly

The most critical environment variable is `DISABLE_STATIC_GENERATION=true`, which is needed to fix the UIProvider errors you were encountering.
