# Setting Up Vercel Environment Variables for Production

Based on your screenshot, I can see that you have successfully connected your project to Vercel, but you're missing the required environment variables for production. This guide will help you set those up.

## Required Environment Variables

From the screenshot, I can see you need to add environment variables in the "Environment Variables" section. Here are the variables you need to add:

1. **VERCEL_PROJECT_ID**: `prj_7uKXTp60gosR1DMXBpOaI0hTyPEO`
2. **NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT**: `production`
3. **NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL**: `https://api.autoagibuilder.com` (or your actual API URL)
4. **DISABLE_STATIC_GENERATION**: `true` (This is crucial to fix the UIProvider errors)

## Steps to Add Environment Variables

1. In your Vercel dashboard, go to your project settings
2. Scroll down to the "Environment Variables" section
3. Click "Add Environment Variable" button
4. Add each of the variables listed above, one by one:

   For each variable:
   - Enter the variable name (e.g., `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`)
   - Enter the value (e.g., `prj_7uKXTp60gosR1DMXBpOaI0hTyPEO`)
   - Make sure "Production" is selected in the environment dropdown
   - Click "Add" to save

5. After adding all variables, you'll need to redeploy your application for the changes to take effect

## How to Redeploy After Adding Environment Variables

1. Go to the "Deployments" tab in your Vercel project
2. Find your most recent deployment
3. Click on the three dots menu (â‹®) next to it
4. Select "Redeploy" from the dropdown menu
5. Confirm the redeployment

## Verifying Environment Variables Are Applied

After redeployment:

1. Go to the "Deployments" tab
2. Click on your latest deployment
3. Navigate to the "Functions" tab
4. You should see your environment variables listed under each function's details

## Troubleshooting Common Environment Variable Issues

If your application still shows errors after setting up environment variables:

1. **Case sensitivity**: Ensure variable names match exactly as expected in the code
2. **Prefix issues**: Make sure `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix is used for all variables that need to be accessible on the client side
3. **Access timing**: Some variables might not be available during build time, ensure your code handles this gracefully
4. **Quotation marks**: Don't include quotation marks in the variable values unless they're actually part of the value

## Additional Environment Variables You Might Need

Depending on your application, you might also need to add:

- **Authentication variables** (if you're using Auth0, Firebase, etc.)
- **Database connection strings**
- **API keys for third-party services**
- **Feature flags specific to production**

Make sure to add these to the production environment as well.

## Next Steps

After setting up your environment variables:

1. Check the build logs to ensure there are no errors related to missing variables
2. Test your application thoroughly in the production environment
3. Verify all features are working as expected
4. If you encounter specific errors related to environment variables, check your application code to ensure it's correctly accessing these variables

Remember that changes to environment variables require a redeployment to take effect. You cannot modify environment variables for an existing deployment.
