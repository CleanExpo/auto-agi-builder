# Comprehensive Deployment Solution for Auto AGI Builder

## Overview

This deployment solution addresses the UIContext provider error and provides a complete setup for deploying the Auto AGI Builder application to Vercel. The solution includes environment management tools, documentation, and configuration for custom domain setup.

## Core Issue Resolution

The error "useUI must be used within a UIProvider" was occurring because Next.js was prerendering pages before context providers were properly initialized. This has been fixed by:

1. Disabling static generation in the Next.js configuration
2. Adding proper error boundaries
3. Ensuring correct provider initialization order

## Solution Components

### Environment Configuration

- **Template Files**
  - `deployment/frontend/.env.template`: Template for environment variables
  
- **Setup Tools**
  - `deployment/create-env-file.js`: Interactive script to create .env files
  - `deployment/setup-env.bat`: Windows batch script for environment setup
  - `deployment/setup-env.ps1`: PowerShell script for environment setup

### Documentation

- **Environment Management**
  - `deployment/UPDATE-ENV-VARIABLES.md`: Guide for setting up environment variables
  
- **Domain Configuration**
  - `deployment/CUSTOM-DOMAIN-SETUP.md`: Guide for configuring DNS records
    - CNAME record: `www` → `cname.vercel-dns.com.`
    - A record: `@` → `76.76.21.21`
  
- **Troubleshooting**
  - `deployment/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`: Solutions for common deployment issues
  
- **GitHub Integration**
  - `deployment/github-secrets-setup.md`: Instructions for GitHub Actions configuration
    - Vercel Project ID: `prj_7uKXTp60gosR1DMXBpOaI0hTyPEO`

### Workflow Configuration

- **Vercel Integration**
  - Configured for root directory: `deployment/frontend`
  - Build command: `npm run build`
  - Output directory: `.next`

## How to Use This Solution

1. **Environment Setup**
   ```
   cd deployment
   ./setup-env.ps1  # or setup-env.bat for Command Prompt
   ```

2. **Configure Vercel Project**
   - Create a new project in Vercel
   - Configure with root directory: `deployment/frontend`
   - Add the environment variables from your .env.local file

3. **Setup Custom Domain**
   - Add DNS records as specified in `CUSTOM-DOMAIN-SETUP.md`
   - Configure domain in Vercel project settings

4. **Configure GitHub Actions (Optional)**
   - Add the required secrets using the values from `github-secrets-setup.md`
   - This enables automatic deployment on code push

## Technical Details

### UIContext Provider Fix

The core issue was resolved by updating the Next.js configuration to disable static generation, which prevents pages from being rendered before context providers are initialized. This was implemented in `next.config.js` with:

```js
module.exports = {
  // ... existing configuration
  experimental: {
    disableStaticGeneration: true
  }
}
```

Additionally, proper error boundaries were added to gracefully handle any potential context errors.

### Environment Management

The environment setup scripts automate the process of creating .env files from templates, ensuring all required variables are properly set.

### Deployment Process

The deployment process leverages Vercel's integration with GitHub for seamless continuous deployment. Once configured, changes pushed to the main branch will automatically trigger a new deployment.

## Next Steps

After implementing this solution:

1. Configure Vercel as described
2. Set up custom domain DNS records
3. Test the deployment by making a small change and pushing it to GitHub
