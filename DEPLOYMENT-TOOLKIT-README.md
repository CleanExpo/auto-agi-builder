### Verification Tools

6. **verify-deployment.bat** - Tests deployed application
   - Checks frontend accessibility
   - Tests API health endpoints
   - Provides a manual testing checklist
   - Opens browser for visual verification

7. **DEPLOYMENT-VERIFICATION-GUIDE.md** - Detailed verification documentation
   - Frontend verification procedures
   - Backend API verification steps
   - Integration verification tests
   - Common issues and solutions

## Deployment Process

To deploy the Auto AGI Builder platform, follow these steps in order:

### 1. Setup Configuration

Start by setting up the required configuration for your deployment:

```
# Configure database (required for backend)
database-setup.bat

# Configure storage (required for file uploads)
storage-setup.bat

# Configure authentication (optional - defaults to public access)
auth-setup.bat
```

Each script will guide you through the configuration process with interactive prompts and will create the necessary environment files.

### 2. Prepare and Deploy

Once configuration is complete, use the full deployment script:

```
full-deploy.bat
```

This script will:
- Create deployment directories
- Copy and configure your application files
- Set up environment variables
- Configure Vercel settings
- Enhance the UI and SEO
- Provide instructions to finalize deployment

Follow the instructions at the end of the script to complete the deployment process using the Vercel CLI.

### 3. Verify Deployment

After deployment, use the verification tools to ensure everything is working correctly:

```
verify-deployment.bat
```

This script will:
- Test frontend accessibility by opening a browser
- Check API health endpoints
- Guide you through a manual testing process

For a more in-depth verification process, refer to the `DEPLOYMENT-VERIFICATION-GUIDE.md` document.

### 4. Deployment Recovery (if needed)

If you encounter issues with your deployment, you can roll back to a previous working version:

```
rollback-deployment.bat
```

This script provides both manual and automatic options for reverting to a previous deployment.

## Additional Resources

This toolkit also includes:

- **DEPLOYMENT-VERIFICATION-GUIDE.md** - Detailed guide for verifying your deployment
- **FULL-DEPLOYMENT-PLAN.md** - Comprehensive deployment architecture documentation

## Environment Prerequisites

The deployment toolkit requires:

1. Node.js and npm installed
2. Vercel CLI installed (`npm install -g vercel`)
3. Python 3.6+ installed (for configuration testing scripts)
4. Access to a PostgreSQL database (for production deployment)
5. Storage credentials (if using cloud storage)

## Production Considerations

For a production-quality deployment, ensure you have:

1. Set up proper authentication (JWT, Auth0, or Firebase)
2. Configured a reliable database (PostgreSQL recommended)
3. Set up proper cloud storage (S3, Azure, or Google Cloud)
4. Verified CORS settings for API connectivity
5. Tested all key user flows
6. Set up monitoring and analytics

The verification tools will help you confirm these aspects of your deployment.
