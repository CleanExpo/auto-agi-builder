# Auto AGI Builder Deployment Tasks

Based on the current state of the project, here are the essential tasks needed to complete the Auto AGI Builder deployment. While our deployment scripts are functioning properly, the application itself requires additional implementation work to be fully functional.

## Current Status

- The deployment scripts (`vercel-cli-deploy.bat`, `optimized-vercel-deploy.bat`, and `run-full-deploy.bat`) are operational
- Authentication with Vercel CLI is working successfully
- The basic project structure exists but contains numerous placeholder components
- Many features are incomplete or non-functional
- The application stack requires further development

## Critical Implementation Tasks

### Frontend Tasks

1. **Complete Homepage Implementation**
   - Fill in empty placeholders in `frontend/components/home/HeroSection.js`
   - Complete implementation of `frontend/components/home/FeatureSection.js`
   - Finalize user onboarding flow in `frontend/components/home/QuickStartForm.js`

2. **Authentication System**
   - Complete the authentication flow in `frontend/pages/auth/login.js`
   - Link authentication to backend API
   - Implement session management in `frontend/contexts/AuthContext.js`

3. **Core Functionality**
   - Complete document analysis feature in `frontend/components/DocumentAnalyzer.js`
   - Implement requirements management in `frontend/components/RequirementsList.js`
   - Finish ROI calculator implementation in `frontend/components/ROI/BusinessMetricsForm.js`

4. **Dashboard and Navigation**
   - Complete the dashboard layout in `frontend/pages/dashboard.js`
   - Implement responsive design for mobile/tablet in `frontend/components/layout/MobileSidebar.js`
   - Finalize navigation structure in `frontend/components/layout/Navbar.js`

### Backend Tasks

1. **API Endpoints**
   - Complete core API implementation in `app/api/v1/api.py`
   - Implement document import logic in `app/api/document_import.py`
   - Finalize requirements API in `app/api/v1/endpoints/requirements.py`

2. **Data Processing**
   - Complete demo data generation in `app/services/demo_data/generator.py`
   - Implement ROI calculations in `app/api/v1/endpoints/roi.py`
   - Finalize prototype generation in `app/api/v1/endpoints/prototype.py`

3. **Authentication & Security**
   - Complete JWT implementation in `app/core/auth/jwt.py`
   - Finish user management in `app/core/auth/users.py`
   - Implement proper error handling in `app/core/error_handling.py`

### Integration Tasks

1. **Frontend-Backend Integration**
   - Ensure API client in `frontend/lib/api.js` properly connects to all endpoints
   - Complete data flow between frontend forms and backend storage
   - Implement real-time updates where needed

2. **Third-party Services**
   - Complete email integration in `app/services/email/sendgrid_service.py`
   - Finalize storage service in `app/services/storage/s3_service.py`
   - Implement monitoring in `app/core/monitoring/sentry.py`

## Build & Deployment Steps

1. **Pre-build Tasks**
   - Ensure all environment variables are properly set in `.env` files
   - Validate configuration in `frontend/next.config.js` and `vercel.json`
   - Check package dependencies in `package.json` and `requirements.txt`

2. **Build Process Improvements**
   - Add pre-build validation in deployment scripts
   - Implement build caching for faster deployments
   - Add environment-specific build configurations

3. **Testing & Verification**
   - Run frontend tests before deployment
   - Implement API endpoint tests
   - Add end-to-end testing with `e2e-tests/critical-journeys.spec.js`

## Deployment Strategy

To successfully deploy the Auto AGI Builder while development is still in progress:

1. **Phased Deployment Approach**
   - Deploy a minimal viable product (MVP) with core features first
   - Add additional features in subsequent deployments
   - Consider feature flags for in-progress functionality

2. **Environment Management**
   - Set up separate development, staging, and production environments
   - Use environment-specific configuration and feature flags
   - Implement proper versioning for each deployment

3. **Monitoring & Feedback**
   - Set up error tracking and performance monitoring
   - Implement user feedback collection mechanisms
   - Create a rapid iteration cycle for addressing issues

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. Complete the highest priority frontend and backend tasks
2. Set up a staging environment for testing
3. Deploy a minimal viable version to production
4. Gather initial feedback and prioritize remaining tasks
5. Implement continuous integration and deployment pipeline
6. Schedule regular updates with new features and improvements

Our deployment scripts are ready to execute these deployments when the application code is ready, with options for full-stack, frontend-only, or backend-only deployments as needed during the development process.
