  echo The All Context Providers Fix has been applied successfully.
  echo This should resolve all remaining context provider errors during prerendering.
  echo.
  echo The comprehensive fix includes:
  echo  - SSR compatibility for all context providers (UIProvider, AuthProvider, ClientProvider, ProjectProvider)
  echo  - Advanced error handling with detailed error boundaries
  echo  - Safe provider HOC pattern to prevent cascading failures
  echo  - A smarter server-side detection system that returns dummy contexts during SSR
  echo  - Defensive coding techniques for all browser API interactions
  echo.
  echo Next steps:
  echo 1. Rebuild your Next.js application with: 
  echo    cd deployment\frontend ^&^& npm run build
  echo 2. Test prerendering to confirm all context errors are resolved
