---

### 2.3 Timeline Slippage
**Risk Level: Medium**

**Description:** The ambitious 16-week timeline might face delays due to unforeseen technical challenges, resource constraints, or external factors.

**Impact:**
- Delayed release of Version 8.0
- Resource allocation conflicts with other projects
- Potential business impact if features are promised to clients
- Team morale issues

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Build buffer time into each sprint
- Identify critical path activities and prioritize resources
- Implement weekly progress tracking against milestones
- Establish early warning indicators for potential delays
- Have contingency plans for the most critical features
- Consider a phased release approach if necessary

## 3. Business Risks

### 3.1 Market Alignment
**Risk Level: Medium**

**Description:** The planned enterprise features and internationalization might not fully align with actual market needs or client expectations.

**Impact:**
- Lower adoption rates
- Reduced ROI on development effort
- Missed market opportunities
- Potential rework to address actual needs

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Conduct market research and client interviews before finalizing features
- Create an advisory group of key clients for regular feedback
- Implement feature flags for A/B testing new capabilities
- Plan for mid-implementation review points to adjust based on feedback
- Prioritize features with clear client demand

---

### 3.2 Regulatory Compliance
