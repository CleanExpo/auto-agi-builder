# Remaining Implementation Stages

The Auto AGI Builder implementation requires several important stages for completion, including both the core homepage implementation and additional Context 7 MCP features:

## Homepage Finalization Stages

### 1. Asset Creation and Collection

- Create or collect all required image assets:
  - Feature section icons 
  - Testimonial user photos
  - Company logos
  - Hero section illustration
- Place all assets in the appropriate `/public/images/` directories
- Ensure all assets are optimized for web (compressed, appropriate formats)

### 2. End-to-End Testing

- Create Playwright or Cypress tests to verify key functionality:
  - Authentication flow works correctly
  - Responsive design adapts to different screen sizes
  - Dark mode switching works properly
  - Project management functions operate correctly
- Implement automated visual regression testing

### 3. Analytics Integration

- Complete the implementation of `utils/analytics.js`
- Configure proper event tracking for all interactive elements
- Set up proper analytics dashboard configuration
- Add conversion tracking for CTAs

### 4. Accessibility Improvements

- Conduct a thorough accessibility audit
- Fix any WCAG compliance issues
- Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Ensure proper color contrast in all themes

### 5. Performance Optimization

- Run Lighthouse performance audits
- Optimize image loading with proper sizing and formats
- Implement code splitting if needed
- Add appropriate caching strategies

### 6. Browser Compatibility Testing

- Test on all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Test on both desktop and mobile browsers
- Fix any browser-specific issues

### 7. Deployment

- Run final pre-deployment validation
- Execute the deployment process:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  node scripts/deployment_checklist.js
  ./scripts/redeploy.sh  # or .\scripts\redeploy.bat on Windows
  ```
- Verify the deployed implementation works correctly
- Monitor analytics and error reporting after deployment

### 8. Documentation Updates

- Update project README with homepage implementation details
- Document any required maintenance procedures
- Create user documentation for the homepage features

## Context 7 MCP Feature Stages

### 9. Client Information Management MCP

- Design and implement client data schema (organization details, logo, industry, etc.)
- Create client profile pages with editable fields and branding options
- Implement client data integration throughout the application
- Build organization management features (team roles and permissions)
- Develop client-specific settings and preferences storage
- Test client data flow and integration with existing systems

### 10. Localization Framework MCP

- Create a robust localization system supporting multiple regions, starting with Australia
- Implement regional settings for date formats, currency, measurement units, and time zones
- Build a tax configuration system with Australian GST support
- Integrate region-specific regulatory compliance features
- Develop geographical data sources for region-specific information
- Create an admin interface for managing localization settings
- Test localization throughout the application

### 11. Perplexity-Powered Chatbot MCP

- Implement a live chat interface with modern UI/UX
- Build integration layer with Perplexity LLM
- Create context retrieval system for client project data
- Implement conversation history storage
- Build knowledge management system
- Develop secure authentication for chatbot
- Create analytics for chatbot effectiveness
- Test chatbot functionality and responsiveness

### 12. Google Cloud Integration MCP

- Migrate from AWS services to Google Cloud Platform
- Implement Google Cloud Run for containerized deployment
- Configure Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL
- Set up Google Cloud Storage for files
- Implement Google Cloud Functions
- Configure logging and monitoring
- Develop GCP-specific deployment scripts
- Create multi-cloud option framework
- Test all cloud services and functionality

## Implementation Approach

For each Context 7 MCP feature:
1. Design data schemas and component architecture
2. Implement backend services and APIs
3. Create frontend components and interfaces
4. Integrate with existing application components
5. Thoroughly test functionality
6. Document implementation details and usage

All implementations will follow the Sequential Thinking MCP methodology to ensure:
- Clean data flows
- Proper error handling
- Comprehensive testing
- Clear documentation
