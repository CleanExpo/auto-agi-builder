# Auto AGI Builder Domain Configuration Toolkit

This toolkit provides everything you need to configure and verify your custom domain (`autoagibuilder.app`) for your Vercel-deployed Auto AGI Builder application.

## Current Status

Based on our initial configuration attempt, we've discovered:

1. The apex domain (`autoagibuilder.app`) is currently assigned to a project called "local-lift"
2. The www subdomain (`www.autoagibuilder.app`) is already assigned to the "auto-agi-builder" project
3. Both domains are pending verification

## Components in this Toolkit

1. **Auto Configuration Script** (`auto-domain-config.js`)
   - Attempts to automatically configure your domains with Vercel
   - Requires Vercel API token with correct permissions
   - Already configured with your provided token

2. **Verification Script** (`verify-domain-status.js`)
   - Checks the current status of your domains in Vercel
   - Verifies DNS records and accessibility
   - Provides detailed information about any issues

3. **Configuration Plan** (`domain-configuration-plan.md`)
   - Step-by-step instructions for resolving domain assignment issues
   - Detailed DNS configuration guide
   - Troubleshooting tips

4. **Documentation** (`README-domain-configurator.md`)
   - Comprehensive usage guide
   - Explanation of all features
   - Background information on domain configuration

5. **Easy-Run Scripts**:
   - Windows: `verify-domain.bat` and `run-domain-config.bat`
   - Mac/Linux: `verify-domain.sh` and `run-domain-config.sh`

## How to Use This Toolkit

### For automatic configuration attempt (Windows):

1. Double-click on `run-domain-config.bat`
2. Follow the on-screen instructions
3. If there are issues, refer to `domain-configuration-plan.md`

### For automatic configuration attempt (Mac/Linux):

1. Open Terminal in this directory
2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x run-domain-config.sh`
3. Run the script: `./run-domain-config.sh`
4. Follow the on-screen instructions

### To verify domain status (Windows):

1. Double-click on `verify-domain.bat`
2. Review the results
3. Follow the recommendations from the verification script

### To verify domain status (Mac/Linux):

1. Open Terminal in this directory
2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x verify-domain.sh`
3. Run the script: `./verify-domain.sh`
4. Review the results

## Current Issues and Resolution

The main issue is that your domains are assigned to different projects. To resolve this:

1. Follow the steps in `domain-configuration-plan.md` to consolidate domains
2. Configure proper DNS records as outlined in the plan
3. Run the verification script to check progress
4. Test your domains after DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)

## Environment Configuration

The `.env` file is already configured with your Vercel API token:
```
VERCEL_TOKEN=ETMf43Je9tpo7EOm9XBNPvQx
```

This token is used by all scripts in this toolkit to authenticate with the Vercel API.

## Next Steps

1. Review `domain-configuration-plan.md`
2. Consolidate your domains in the Vercel dashboard
3. Configure your DNS records
4. Run `verify-domain.bat` (or `./verify-domain.sh` on Mac/Linux) to check progress
5. Wait for DNS propagation
6. Test your domains in a browser
