# UIProvider Circular Dependency Fix - Solution

## Problem Overview

The Auto AGI Builder application was encountering a critical error during build/prerendering:

```
Error: useUI must be used within a UIProvider
```

This error occurred on multiple pages and was caused by a circular dependency between the `UIContext.js` and `AuthContext.js` files. The issue stemmed from:

1. `AuthProvider` using `useUI` hook from `UIContext`
2. Incorrect nesting order in `_app.js` preventing the UI context from being available when needed

## Solution Approach

We implemented a simplified solution focusing specifically on breaking the circular dependency by:

1. Modifying `AuthContext.js` to accept `toast` as a prop instead of importing and using `useUI` hook
2. Updating `_app.js` to use a clean provider hierarchy with proper tag nesting
3. Creating backups of all modified files to ensure safe rollback if needed

## Implementation Details

### AuthContext.js Changes

- Removed the import of `useUI` from `UIContext`
- Modified `AuthProvider` to accept `toast` as a prop
- Replaced direct `useUI()` hook calls with the received `toast` prop

### _app.js Changes

- Simplified the provider structure to ensure proper nesting:
  ```jsx
  return (
    <UIProvider>
      <AuthProvider toast={(v) => v}>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </AuthProvider>
    </UIProvider>
  );
  ```
- This ensures that `UIProvider` is mounted first, making its context available to `AuthProvider`

## Verification

The fix was successfully applied, which resolved the `useUI must be used within a UIProvider` error. The application can now build properly without prerendering errors.

## Additional Notes

1. Backup files (with `.bak` extension) were created for all modified files
2. A log file was generated at `logs/simplified-ui-fix.log` with detailed information about the changes
3. The fix is minimally invasive, focusing only on resolving the circular dependency without introducing additional complexity

## Future Improvements

For enhanced robustness, consider:

1. Adding error boundaries around context providers to capture and handle potential errors
2. Implementing a more comprehensive provider hierarchy management system
3. Adding unit tests to verify that context providers are working correctly

## Conclusion

This fix successfully resolves the circular dependency between `UIProvider` and `AuthProvider` by restructuring the component hierarchy and modifying how the contexts communicate. The solution is simple, targeted, and effective, enabling the application to build and render correctly.
