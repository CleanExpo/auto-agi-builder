# UI Provider Fix: Solution Documentation

## Problem Overview

The Auto AGI Builder application was encountering critical errors during prerendering with the message:

```
Error: useUI must be used within a UIProvider
```

This error occurred across multiple pages including:
- Home page (/)
- Auth pages (/auth/verify-email, /auth/login, /auth/reset-password, etc.)
- Main application pages (/projects, /requirements, /roadmap, etc.)

## Root Cause Analysis

The core issue was that components were attempting to use the `useUI` hook without being properly wrapped by a `UIProvider` context provider. This commonly happens in React applications when:

1. Components are using context hooks outside their provider's scope
2. The context provider hierarchy is not properly structured
3. The provider is not wrapping the components during server-side rendering

In this specific case, the error occurred during Next.js's static generation phase (prerendering), indicating that the context provider structure wasn't properly set up for server-side rendering.

## Solution: Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The solution implements a "Model Context Protocol" (MCP) system inspired by modern React application architecture patterns that provides:

### 1. Context Provider Registry

We created a central registry system that allows context providers to register themselves, making the provider structure more maintainable and allowing for automatic dependency management.

```javascript
// Global registry of context providers
const contextProviders = [];

export function registerContextProvider(registration) {
  // Registration validation and handling
  contextProviders.push({
    ...registration,
    options: { ...options, id }
  });
}
```

### 2. Provider Composition

A composition helper that handles wrapping children with registered providers in the correct order:

```javascript
function composeProviders(providers, children) {
  return providers.reduceRight((composed, { Provider }) => {
    return <Provider>{composed}</Provider>;
  }, children);
}

export function ModuleContextProvider({ children }) {
  // Sort providers by priority
  const sortedProviders = [...contextProviders].sort((a, b) => {
    const priorityA = a.options?.priority || 50;
    const priorityB = b.options?.priority || 50;
    return priorityA - priorityB;
  });

  // Wrap children with all registered providers
  return composeProviders(sortedProviders, children);
}
```

### 3. Higher-Order Component Pattern

A HOC that wraps the entire application with the UIProvider context:

```javascript
export function withUIProvider(Component) {
  return function UIProviderWrapper(props) {
    return (
      <ModuleContextProvider>
        <Component {...props} />
      </ModuleContextProvider>
    );
  };
}
```

### 4. Enhanced UIContext Implementation

```javascript
// UI context with proper error handling
export const useUI = () => {
  const context = useContext(UIContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error('useUI must be used within a UIProvider');
  }
  return context;
};

// Register the context with the MCP system
registerContextProvider({
  Provider: UIProvider,
  useContext: useUI,
  options: {
    id: 'ui',
    priority: 10
  },
});
```

## Implementation

The implementation consists of:

1. Creating the MCP system in the `lib/mcp` directory
2. Updating the UIContext implementation to use the MCP system
3. Modifying `_app.js` to wrap the entire application with the UIProvider

All of this is packaged in the `fix-ui-provider.js` script, which:

- Creates the necessary directory structure
- Generates the MCP implementation files
- Updates the UIContext component
- Modifies _app.js to use the withUIProvider HOC

## Benefits

The MCP approach provides several benefits over a traditional context implementation:

1. **Modularity**: Each context is self-contained and registers itself
2. **Priority-based ordering**: Contexts with dependencies can be ordered correctly
3. **Error handling**: Clear error messages when hooks are used outside providers
4. **Composability**: Easy to add new context providers without modifying _app.js
5. **Server-side rendering compatible**: Works properly with Next.js prerendering

## Verification

To verify the fix is working correctly:

1. Run the `run-ui-provider-fix.bat` script
2. Rebuild the application with `next build`
3. Verify that the prerendering errors have been resolved
4. Test the application to ensure all functionality works correctly

## Future Considerations

This MCP system provides a foundation for other context providers. Additional contexts like ThemeContext, AuthContext, etc. can be added following the same pattern and will automatically be integrated into the provider hierarchy.
