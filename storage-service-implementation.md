# Storage Service Implementation

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the storage service for the Auto AGI Builder application. The storage service enables secure file storage and retrieval using AWS S3, with a flexible API for handling various file operations.

## Components Implemented

### 1. S3 Storage Service (`app/services/storage/s3_service.py`)

- Created a comprehensive service for interacting with AWS S3:
  - `upload_file`: Upload a file from a local path to S3
  - `upload_fileobj`: Upload a file-like object to S3
  - `download_file`: Download a file from S3 to a local path
  - `get_object`: Get an object from S3 as a stream
  - `delete_object`: Delete an object from S3
  - `list_objects`: List objects in an S3 bucket
  - `generate_presigned_url`: Generate temporary access URLs for S3 objects
  - `generate_unique_object_name`: Create unique filenames for S3 objects

- Implemented robust error handling and configuration:
  - Graceful handling of missing credentials
  - Comprehensive error reporting
  - Configurable default bucket and region
  - Automatic content type detection

## Architecture

The storage service follows a layered architecture:

1. **AWS S3 Layer**: Direct integration with the AWS S3 API
2. **Service Layer**: High-level methods for common file operations
3. **Application Layer**: API endpoints and UI components that leverage the storage service

This architecture provides several advantages:
- **Abstraction**: The S3-specific implementation details are hidden from the application
- **Flexibility**: Files can be manipulated and accessed in various ways
- **Extensibility**: Additional storage providers could be added in the future

## Features

1. **File Upload**
   - Support for uploading from local file paths
   - Support for uploading file-like objects (e.g., form uploads)
   - Content type detection and metadata support
   - Public/private access control

2. **File Download**
   - Direct file download to local filesystem
   - Stream-based access for efficient processing
   - Temporary URL generation for client-side access

3. **File Management**
   - Listing files with filtering and pagination
   - File deletion
   - Metadata retrieval

4. **Security**
   - Secure temporary URLs with expiration
   - Support for various access control methods
   - Credential management via environment variables

## Integration Points

The S3 storage service integrates with several key application features:

1. **Document Management**
   - Storing uploaded documents for processing
   - Organizing documents in project-specific folders

2. **Prototype Generation**
   - Storing generated prototype files
   - Providing access to prototype assets

3. **Export Functionality**
   - Storing generated PDF, Excel, CSV, and JSON exports
   - Providing download links for exported data

4. **User Profile Management**
   - Storing user profile pictures and attachments

## Configuration

The S3 storage service is configurable through environment variables:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: AWS access key for authentication
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: AWS secret key for authentication
- `AWS_REGION`: AWS region for S3 access (defaults to us-east-1)
- `AWS_S3_BUCKET`: Default S3 bucket for file storage

## Security Considerations

1. **Credential Management**
   - AWS credentials are loaded from environment variables
   - Credentials are never exposed in responses or logs
   - Warning logs when credentials are missing

2. **Access Control**
   - Files can be set as public or private
   - Presigned URLs provide temporary, secure access to private files
   - Limited exposure of internal S3 paths

3. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging
   - No leakage of sensitive information in error messages

## Future Enhancements

1. **Cloud Provider Abstraction**
   - Add support for other cloud storage providers
   - Implement provider selection logic

2. **Content Delivery Network (CDN) Integration**
   - Connect with AWS CloudFront or similar CDN services
   - Improve delivery speed for frequently accessed files

3. **Advanced File Operations**
   - File compression/decompression
   - Image resizing and optimization
   - Video transcoding

4. **Backup and Archiving**
   - Implement lifecycle policies for automatic archiving
   - Create backup routines for critical data

5. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Track usage statistics
   - Implement size limits and quotas
