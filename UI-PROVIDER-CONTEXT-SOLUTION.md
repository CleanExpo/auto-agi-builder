# Auto AGI Builder UI Provider & Deployment Fix

## Problem Summary

The Auto AGI Builder application was encountering two critical issues affecting deployment and functionality:

1. **UI Provider Error**: The error "useUI must be used within a UIProvider" occurred during server-side rendering (SSR) in Next.js across multiple pages. This prevented proper prerendering of pages during build and deployment.

2. **Domain Configuration Issues**: The site at www.autoagibuilder.app shows a 404 NOT_FOUND error due to:
   - Invalid redirect pattern in vercel.json using `http://:host(.+)`
   - Possible DNS configuration issues
   - Deployment configuration problems

## Root Cause Analysis

### UI Provider Error

The SSR-related errors occurred because:
1. The UIContext was not providing default values during server-side rendering
2. The hook `useUI()` was throwing an error when used outside a UIProvider component
3. The problem was exacerbated by static optimization in Next.js, which attempts to prerender pages

### Domain Configuration Issues

The domain issues stemmed from:
1. Invalid redirect pattern syntax in vercel.json
2. Missing or improperly configured DNS records
3. Incorrect domain verification in Vercel

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. UI Provider Fix

We modified the UIContext implementation in `fix-ui-provider.js`:
- Added default context values that prevent errors during SSR
- Enhanced the `useUI()` hook to gracefully handle being called outside a provider
- Updated the provider implementation to safely access localStorage/window (browser-only APIs)
- Improved dark mode handling with proper client-side effects

### 2. Vercel Configuration Fix

In `fix-vercel-json.js`, we:
- Fixed the invalid host pattern redirect
- Replaced it with a standard header-based HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect
- Ensured proper status code (308) for permanent redirects

### 3. Deployment Scripts

Created multi-shell deployment solutions:
- PowerShell script (`deploy-all-fixes.ps1`) for modern environments
- Batch script (`deploy-all-fixes.bat`) for traditional Windows environments
- Universal launcher (`run-deploy-fixes.bat`) that detects the environment

### 4. DNS Documentation

Created `DOMAIN-TROUBLESHOOTING-GUIDE.md` with:
- DNS record requirements
- Step-by-step troubleshooting instructions
- Advanced diagnostics for domain issues
- Resources for further assistance

## How To Deploy the Fix

1. Run the universal launcher:
   ```
   .\run-deploy-fixes.bat
   ```

   This will automatically:
   - Fix the UI Provider implementation
   - Update the vercel.json configuration
   - Verify domain settings
   - Build the project with correct settings
   - Deploy to Vercel (with your approval)

2. After deployment, verify:
   - DNS settings according to the guide
   - A record for autoagibuilder.app → 76.76.21.21
   - CNAME record for www.autoagibuilder.app → cname.vercel-dns.com

3. Monitor the deployment through the Vercel dashboard:
   - Check domain settings
   - Verify SSL configuration
   - Monitor deployment logs

## Technical Implementation Details

### Modified UIContext

The UIContext now includes:

```javascript
// Default context values for SSR compatibility
const defaultContextValue = {
  isDarkMode: false,
  toggleDarkMode: () => {},
  isMenuOpen: false,
  toggleMenu: () => {},
  closeMenu: () => {},
  isMobileView: false
};

// Create context with default value for SSR compatibility
const UIContext = createContext(defaultContextValue);

export function useUI() {
  const context = useContext(UIContext);
  // Return context even if undefined (SSR compatibility)
  return context;
}
```

### Vercel JSON Configuration

The redirect configuration was updated from:
```json
{
  "source": "http://:host(.+)",
  ...
}
```

To a proper header-based redirect:
```json
{
  "source": "/(.*)",
  "destination": "https://www.autoagibuilder.app/$1",
  "statusCode": 308,
  "has": [
    {
      "type": "header",
      "key": "x-forwarded-proto",
      "value": "http"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor DNS Propagation**:
   - DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to fully propagate
   - Use DNS propagation checking tools to verify
   - Test from different networks

2. **Verify SSL Certificate**:
   - Check for valid HTTPS after deployment
   - Ensure automatic certificate issuance is working

3. **Test All Pages**:
   - Verify the UI Provider error is resolved
   - Test authentication flows
   - Check critical application features
