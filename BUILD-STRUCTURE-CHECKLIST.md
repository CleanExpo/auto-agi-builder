## Next Implementation Steps

Based on our progress and the implementation roadmap, the next priorities are:

1. **Authentication Backend**
   - Create `app/api/v1/endpoints/auth.py` with login and registration endpoints
   - Implement JWT token generation and validation
   - Add user profile endpoint

2. **Frontend Authentication**
   - Implement Auth context and login/registration forms
   - Set up token storage and management
   - Create protected route middleware

3. **Project Management**
   - Create project database models
   - Implement project CRUD endpoints
   - Complete QuickStartForm implementation
   - Build project listing and detail views

## Current Status Summary

- **Deployment & Compression System**: 100% complete
- **Frontend Assets & Components**: 90% complete
- **Homepage Implementation**: 100% complete
- **Authentication System**: 0% complete
- **Project Management**: 0% complete
- **Requirements Management**: 0% complete
- **Advanced Features**: 0% complete

The compression and deployment infrastructure is now completely set up, and the homepage components are fully implemented. The next phase should focus on implementing the authentication system and project management functionality to make the application interactive.
