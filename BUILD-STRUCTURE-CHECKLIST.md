## Next Implementation Steps

Based on our progress and the implementation roadmap, the next priorities are:

1. **Project Management**
   - Create project database models in `app/db/models/project.py`
   - Implement project CRUD endpoints in `app/api/v1/endpoints/projects.py`
   - Add project schemas in `app/schemas/project.py`
   - Create project list and detail pages in frontend

2. **Requirements Management**
   - Create requirements database models linking to projects
   - Implement requirements CRUD endpoints
   - Create frontend requirements components
   - Integrate with project views

3. **Document Analysis & Import**
   - Implement file upload and storage system
   - Create document analysis service
   - Build document import and preview UI

## Current Status Summary

- **Deployment & Compression System**: 100% complete
- **Frontend Assets & Components**: 90% complete
- **Homepage Implementation**: 100% complete
- **Authentication System**: 100% complete
- **Project Management**: 0% complete
- **Requirements Management**: 0% complete
- **Advanced Features**: 0% complete

The compression and deployment infrastructure, homepage components, and authentication system are now fully implemented. The next phase should focus on implementing project management functionality as the core application feature.
