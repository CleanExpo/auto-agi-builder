## Next Implementation Steps

According to the implementation roadmap and first steps guide, the next priorities are:

1. **Frontend Asset Creation**
   - Create prototype example image and SVG icons

2. **Homepage Component Integration**
   - Implement and connect homepage components
   - Add smooth scrolling for navigation

3. **Authentication Backend**
   - Create auth endpoints
   - Implement user model and JWT functionality

4. **Frontend Authentication**
   - Connect login and registration forms to backend
   - Implement token storage and management

5. **Project Management**
   - Create project models and endpoints
   - Implement project UI components

## Current Status Summary

- **Deployment & Compression System**: 100% complete
- **Frontend Assets & Components**: 0% complete
- **Authentication System**: 0% complete
- **Project Management**: 0% complete
- **Requirements Management**: 0% complete
- **Advanced Features**: 0% complete

The compression and deployment infrastructure is now completely set up, providing a solid foundation for the next phase of development which should focus on implementing the core application functionality starting with the homepage, authentication, and project management features.
