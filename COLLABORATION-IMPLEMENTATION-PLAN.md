# Collaboration Features Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the remaining collaboration features in the Auto AGI Builder.

## Overview

The following collaboration features are planned for implementation in the next phase:

1. RoadmapVisualizer component
2. Timeline controls
3. Comment functionality
4. Real-time collaboration features

## 1. RoadmapVisualizer Component

### Purpose
The RoadmapVisualizer will provide a visual representation of the project roadmap, showing phases, milestones, and timeline for implementation.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Add milestone and phase models to the database
   - Create relations to projects and requirements

2. **Backend API Development**
   - Create CRUD endpoints for milestones and phases
   - Implement filtering and sorting capabilities

3. **Frontend Components**
   - Create `RoadmapVisualizer.js` with the following features:
     - Gantt chart visualization
     - Drag-and-drop milestone adjustments
     - Phase coloring and grouping
     - Dependency visualization
     - Export to PDF/PNG capabilities

4. **Integration**
   - Add RoadmapVisualizer to Project detail page
   - Link requirements to roadmap items
   - Add reporting capabilities

## 2. Timeline Controls

### Purpose
Timeline controls will allow users to manipulate the project timeline, adjust durations, and visualize progress over time.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Timeline Controller Component**
   - Create `TimelineControls.js` component with:
     - Date range selector
     - Zoom controls
     - Timeline navigation
     - Filtering options

2. **Timeline Data Service**
   - Implement `timelineService.js` for:
     - Calculating project progress
     - Generating timeline data
     - Sorting and filtering timeline events

3. **Integration**
   - Integrate with RoadmapVisualizer
   - Add timeline controls to project overview
   - Implement timeline events for all project activities

## 3. Comment Functionality

### Purpose
Comment functionality will enable discussions attached to specific project elements (requirements, documents, prototypes, etc.).

### Implementation Steps
1. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Create comment model with relations to various entities
   - Implement threaded comment support
   - Add mention and notification capabilities

2. **Backend API Development**
   - Create comment CRUD endpoints
   - Implement comment search and filtering
   - Add notifications for comments

3. **Frontend Components**
   - Create `CommentThread.js` component
   - Implement `CommentForm.js` for adding new comments
   - Create `CommentList.js` for displaying comment threads

4. **Integration**
   - Add comment sections to all relevant pages
   - Implement notification system for comment activity
   - Add comment counts to navigation

## 4. Real-time Collaboration Features

### Purpose
Real-time collaboration will allow multiple users to work simultaneously on the same project elements with immediate updates.

### Implementation Steps
1. **WebSocket Infrastructure**
   - Expand current WebSocket implementation
   - Add rooms for project-specific collaboration
   - Implement presence indicators

2. **Operational Transformation**
   - Implement conflict resolution for simultaneous edits
   - Add version history and change tracking
   - Implement undo/redo functionality

3. **Frontend Integration**
   - Add real-time indicators
   - Create user presence visualization
   - Implement cursor sharing for collaborative editing
   - Add activity feed for real-time updates

4. **UI Components**
   - Create `CollaborationIndicator.js` component
   - Implement `PresenceList.js` to show active users
   - Add `ActivityFeed.js` component

## Implementation Priorities

The features will be implemented in the following order:

1. **Comment Functionality** - 3 weeks
   - Provides immediate value with relatively lower implementation complexity
   - Foundation for more advanced collaboration features

2. **RoadmapVisualizer** - 4 weeks
   - Delivers high visual value to project managers
   - Provides framework for timeline controls

3. **Timeline Controls** - 2 weeks
   - Builds on RoadmapVisualizer implementation
   - Enhances project planning capabilities

4. **Real-time Collaboration** - 5 weeks
   - Most complex feature with highest technical requirements
   - Builds on all previous collaboration infrastructure

## Technical Approach

1. **Backend Architecture**
   - Extend current FastAPI backend with additional endpoints
   - Implement WebSocket rooms and channels for real-time features
   - Add database models for comments, presence, and timeline items

2. **Frontend Components**
   - Build all components using React with Material-UI
   - Implement specialized visualization libraries for timeline and roadmap
   - Use context providers for state management

3. **Real-time Infrastructure**
   - Extend WebSocket implementation with Socket.IO or similar
   - Implement operational transformation for conflict resolution
   - Add presence protocol for user availability

## Next Steps

1. Begin with database schema updates for comments
2. Implement comment API endpoints
3. Create frontend comment components
4. Progress to roadmap visualization components
5. Implement timeline controls
6. Finally, add real-time collaboration infrastructure

This phased approach ensures we deliver immediate value while building toward the most complex features.
