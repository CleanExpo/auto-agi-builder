# UIProvider Error Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The issue was identified in multiple areas:

1. The vercel.json configuration had an invalid redirect route pattern: `"http://:host(.+)"` which was causing deployment errors.

2. The "useUI must be used within a UIProvider" error in various pages of the Next.js application was related to:
   - Missing generic type parameter in ModuleContextProviderProps interface
   - TypeScript type export issues in MCP library
   - Missing ErrorBoundary component around context providers
   - Server-side rendering issues with UI context in Next.js

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed vercel.json Configuration
- Replaced the invalid route pattern with a standard HTTP to HTTPS redirect using header-based detection:
```json
{
  "source": "/(.*)",
  "destination": "https://www.autoagibuilder.app/$1",
  "statusCode": 308,
  "has": [
    {
      "type": "header",
      "key": "x-forwarded-proto",
      "value": "http"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. ModuleContextProviderProps Generic Type Fix
- Modified the interface definition to include a generic type parameter
- Updated the provider implementation to use the generic type correctly

### 3. Fix for "useUI must be used within a UIProvider" Error
To properly fix the "useUI must be used within a UIProvider" error, we addressed several aspects:

1. Added proper error boundaries around context providers to prevent error propagation
2. Fixed type exports in MCP library to ensure proper TypeScript compilation
3. Ensured the UIProvider is correctly wrapped around components using useUI hook
4. Modified Next.js config to handle server-side rendering properly

## Deployment Strategy
1. Run the fix-vercel-json.js script to correct the vercel.json configuration
2. Apply the ModuleContextProviderProps generic type fix with fix-provider-type.js
3. Deploy the fixes to Vercel using git-based deployment workflow
4. Verify all pages render correctly without the useUI error

## Future Recommendations
1. Always include proper error boundaries around context providers, especially when dealing with SSR
2. Use TypeScript's export type syntax for interface exports when using isolatedModules
3. Consider disabling static generation for authenticated pages that require UI context
4. Use header-based redirects instead of host patterns for HTTP to HTTPS redirects
