# Vercel SPA Routing Fix

## Issue Identified

When deploying the Auto AGI Builder to Vercel, the application was successfully deployed but the homepage was not accessible. This is a common issue with Single Page Applications (SPAs) deployed to Vercel, where the client-side routing doesn't work properly because the server doesn't know how to handle routes that don't correspond to actual files.

## Solution Implemented

The issue was fixed by updating the `vercel.json` configuration file to include proper routing rules for an SPA using Vercel's recommended "rewrites" approach:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

This rewrite configuration ensures that:

1. All requests are routed to the `index.html` file, allowing the client-side router to handle the routing
2. Static assets are still served correctly because Vercel automatically prioritizes existing files before applying rewrites

## Error Resolution

Our initial attempt using the "routes" property failed with the error:

```
Error: If `rewrites`, `redirects`, `headers`, `cleanUrls` or `trailingSlash` are used, then `routes` cannot be present.
```

The newer `rewrites` property is the recommended approach, and it's incompatible with the legacy `routes` property. The updated configuration resolves this conflict.

## How to Deploy the Fix

A convenience script `deploy-homepage-fix.bat` has been created to:

1. Add the modified vercel.json to git
2. Commit the changes
3. Push to the GitHub repository
4. Deploy to Vercel production

Simply run the script to deploy the fix:

```
.\deploy-homepage-fix.bat
```

## Why This Works

React, Next.js, and other modern JavaScript frameworks use client-side routing for SPAs. When a user navigates to a URL like `/dashboard` or `/profile`, the server needs to return the main `index.html` file, then the JavaScript application handles the routing on the client side.

Without this configuration, when a user directly accesses a route like `/dashboard`, Vercel would try to find a file at that path, fail to find it, and return a 404 error.

This configuration ensures that all routes are handled properly regardless of whether they're accessed directly or through navigation within the application.
