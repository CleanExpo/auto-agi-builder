# Domain Troubleshooting Guide for Auto AGI Builder

## Problem Diagnosis

The Auto AGI Builder application is currently showing a 404 error when accessed via both:
- www.autoagibuilder.app 
- auto-agi-builder-git-main-team-agi.vercel.app

This indicates that the application's domain configuration in Vercel might have issues, causing pages to not be found.

## Root Cause Analysis

After examining the configuration files and error patterns, several potential issues were identified:

1. **Missing Domain Aliases**: The Vercel configuration needs explicit aliases for domains
2. **HTTP to HTTPS Redirects**: Proper redirects are needed for secure connections 
3. **Domain Configuration in Next.js**: Images and API URLs need domain allowlisting
4. **Environment Variables**: Application needs proper domain-related environment variables
5. **SSL Certificate Provisioning**: SSL certificates might still be in the provisioning phase

## Solution: Domain Fix Tools

We've created several tools to help troubleshoot and fix the domain configuration issues:

1. **fix-domain-issue.js**: Core script that fixes issues with Vercel and Next.js configurations
2. **run-domain-fix.bat**: Windows batch file for easy execution of the fix script
3. **verify-domains.js**: Script to verify DNS resolution and HTTPS connectivity

## How to Apply the Fix

1. **Run the domain fix script**:
   ```
   run-domain-fix.bat
   ```
   Or directly with Node.js:
   ```
   node fix-domain-issue.js
   ```

2. **Commit and push changes to your repository**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix domain configuration for Vercel deployment"
   git push
   ```

3. **Redeploy your application in Vercel**:
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Find your project
   - Click "Redeploy" from the dropdown menu

4. **Verify DNS and HTTPS status**:
   ```
   node verify-domains.js
   ```

## Domain Configuration Checklist

- [x] Vercel configuration updated with domain aliases
- [x] Proper redirects set up for HTTP to HTTPS
- [x] Next.js configuration updated with domain settings
- [x] Environment variables set for domain URLs
- [x] DNS records set up correctly (CNAME for www, A record for root domain)
- [ ] Wait for SSL certificate provisioning (can take up to 24 hours)

## Understanding Domain Resolution

For the domain to work properly:

1. DNS records must resolve to Vercel's servers (DNS resolution)
2. Vercel must recognize the domain as belonging to your project (domain aliases)
3. SSL certificates must be fully provisioned (HTTPS security)
4. Application must know its own domain (environment variables)

## SSL Certificate Provisioning

Vercel automatically provisions SSL certificates for your domains. However, this process can take up to 24 hours to complete. During this time, you might see security warnings in your browser, or the site might not load at all.

If you continue to see issues after 24 hours, it's recommended to:

1. Verify your DNS configuration with your domain registrar
2. Check for any verification issues in the Vercel domain settings
3. Consider removing and re-adding the domain in Vercel

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are crucial for proper domain functionality:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://www.autoagibuilder.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.autoagibuilder.app
```

These variables tell your application what its own domain is, which is essential for proper routing, API calls, and other functionality.

## Forcing a Redeploy

If the domain still shows 404 errors after applying fixes, try forcing a complete rebuild in Vercel:

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to your project settings
3. Find the "Build & Development Settings" section
4. Scroll down to "Build Cache" and click "Clear Cache and Redeploy"

## Checking Vercel Logs

If you continue to experience issues, check the deployment logs in Vercel:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Click on "Logs" or "Function Logs"
4. Look for any errors related to routing or domain configuration

## Need Further Assistance?

If you continue to experience issues after following this guide, you may need to:

1. Contact Vercel support for assistance with domain configuration
2. Check if there are any rate limits or restrictions on your Vercel plan
3. Verify that your domain registrar is properly configured

Remember: DNS and SSL propagation can take time. Many domain issues resolve themselves after 24-48 hours.
