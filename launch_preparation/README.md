# Auto AGI Builder - Launch Preparation Toolkit

A comprehensive suite of tools for preparing the Auto AGI Builder platform for production launch.

## Overview

The Launch Preparation Toolkit provides a structured approach to validating and preparing all aspects of the Auto AGI Builder platform for production release. It includes technical validation, business readiness assessment, monitoring configuration, and complete launch readiness evaluation.

## Components

### Technical Finalization

- **Pre-Launch Checklist** (`technical_finalization/pre_launch_checklist.py`)  
  Comprehensive list of technical requirements that must be validated before launch, including security, performance, compliance, and functionality checks.

- **End-to-End Tests** (`technical_finalization/end_to_end_tests.py`)  
  Automated testing of critical user journeys to ensure core functionality is working as expected.

- **Load Testing** (`technical_finalization/load_testing.py`)  
  Performance assessment under various load conditions to ensure the platform can handle expected traffic.

- **Monitoring Configuration** (`technical_finalization/monitoring_config.py`)  
  Configuration generator for Prometheus, Grafana, and AlertManager to establish comprehensive monitoring for the production environment.

### Business Readiness

- **Legal Documents Generator** (`business_readiness/legal_documents_generator.py`)  
  Automated generation of required legal documents (Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, SLA, DPA) based on configurable templates.

### Launch Assessment

- **Launch Readiness Assessment** (`launch_readiness_assessment.py`)  
  Meta-tool that runs all verification components and provides a comprehensive Go/No-Go assessment for launch.

- **Version Control Setup** (`version_control_setup.py`)  
  Utility script to set up Git repository and GitHub integration for the project.

## Installation

The toolkit is designed to be run directly from the project directory without additional installation steps.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Git (for version control setup)
- Access to the Auto AGI Builder codebase

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auto-agi-builder.git
   cd auto-agi-builder
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Complete Launch Assessment

For a comprehensive assessment of launch readiness:

```bash
python launch_preparation/launch_readiness_assessment.py
```

This will:
1. Verify all required components are available
2. Run the pre-launch checklist
3. Execute core end-to-end tests
4. Perform lightweight load testing
5. Validate business readiness
6. Generate a detailed report with Go/No-Go recommendation

### Running Individual Components

#### Technical Validation

```bash
# Run pre-launch checklist
python launch_preparation/technical_finalization/pre_launch_checklist.py

# Run end-to-end tests
python launch_preparation/technical_finalization/end_to_end_tests.py

# Run load testing
python launch_preparation/technical_finalization/load_testing.py --concurrent-users 50 --duration 300 --ramp-up 60

# Generate monitoring configuration
python launch_preparation/technical_finalization/monitoring_config.py --output-dir monitoring
```

#### Business Readiness

```bash
# Generate legal documents
python launch_preparation/business_readiness/legal_documents_generator.py
```

#### Version Control Setup

```bash
# Set up Git repository and GitHub integration
python launch_preparation/version_control_setup.py --github-repo https://github.com/yourusername/auto-agi-builder.git
```

## Configuration

Most components support configuration via command-line arguments or configuration files. Run each script with the `--help` flag to see available options.

Example:

```bash
python launch_preparation/technical_finalization/load_testing.py --help
```

## Report Formats

- **Launch Readiness Report** - Markdown format with detailed assessment results
- **JSON Results** - Machine-readable format for integration with other systems

## Monitoring Stack

The monitoring configuration generates setup for:

- **Prometheus** - Metrics collection and alerting
- **Grafana** - Dashboard visualization
- **AlertManager** - Alert routing and notification
- **Loki** - Log aggregation

Dashboards include:
- System Overview
- API Performance
- Error Tracking

## Legal Documents

The legal documents generator creates:

- Terms of Service
- Privacy Policy
- Service Level Agreement (SLA)
- Data Processing Agreement (DPA)

All documents are generated in Markdown format and can be customized by editing the templates or providing a custom configuration file.
