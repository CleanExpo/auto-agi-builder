# Export Features Implementation

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the export functionality for the Auto AGI Builder application. The export system enables users to export project data in various formats including PDF, Excel, CSV, and JSON.

## Components Implemented

### 1. API Endpoints (`app/api/v1/endpoints/export.py`)

- Created a FastAPI router with the following endpoints:
  - `POST /api/v1/exports`: Create a new export
  - `GET /api/v1/exports`: List available exports with filtering and pagination
  - `GET /api/v1/exports/{export_id}`: Get detailed information about a specific export
  - `GET /api/v1/exports/{export_id}/download`: Download an export file
  - `DELETE /api/v1/exports/{export_id}`: Delete an export (soft or permanent)

- Implemented background task processing for export generation to handle large exports without blocking API responses

### 2. Database Models (`app/models/export.py`)

- Created SQLAlchemy models for export storage:
  - `Export`: Main model for tracking export metadata
  - `ExportStatus`: Enum for tracking export processing status (pending, processing, completed, failed)
  - `ExportType`: Enum for supported export formats (PDF, Excel, CSV, JSON, Image)
  - `ContentType`: Enum for supported content types (project, requirements, ROI, timeline)

- Included fields for:
  - Basic metadata (ID, filename, file path, file size)
  - Tracking (creation time, start time, completion time)
  - Download tracking (download count, last downloaded timestamp)
  - Error handling (status, error message)
  - Soft deletion (is_deleted flag, deletion timestamp)

### 3. Pydantic Schemas (`app/schemas/export.py`)

- Created schemas for request/response validation:
  - `ExportCreateRequest`: For creating new exports
  - `ExportUpdateRequest`: For updating export metadata
  - `ExportDetail`: For detailed export information
  - `ExportListItem`: For export list items
  - `ExportList`: For paginated export lists
  - Enum schemas for export status, type, and content type

### 4. Business Logic Services (`app/services/export/export_service.py`)

- Implemented `ExportService` class with comprehensive functionality:
  - CRUD operations for exports (create, read, update, delete)
  - File generation methods for different export formats
  - Background task processing for asynchronous export generation
  - File format handlers for PDF, Excel, CSV, and JSON
  - Data fetching logic for different content types
  - User access control via permissions checking
  - Download tracking and statistics

## Features

1. **Multiple Export Formats**
   - PDF: Structured document format for presentation
   - Excel: Tabular data for analysis
   - CSV: Simple data exchange format
   - JSON: Structured data for programmatic use

2. **Multiple Content Types**
   - Project: Full project details
   - Requirements: Requirements list and metadata
   - ROI: Return on investment data and charts
   - Timeline: Project timeline with milestones

3. **Background Processing**
   - Non-blocking export generation
   - Status tracking
   - Error handling

4. **User Experience**
   - Download tracking
   - Export history
   - Soft deletion with recovery option

## Architecture

The export system follows a layered architecture:

1. **API Layer**: FastAPI endpoints for handling HTTP requests
2. **Service Layer**: Business logic for export generation and management
3. **Data Layer**: Database models and schemas for data storage

The system uses asynchronous background tasks for handling potentially time-consuming export generation without blocking API responses.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced PDF Generation**: Implement full PDF report generation with proper formatting and styling
2. **Excel Templates**: Create customizable Excel templates for different export types
3. **Email Delivery**: Add option to email exports to users when complete
4. **Export Compression**: Implement ZIP compression for large exports
5. **Additional Formats**: Support for additional export formats like Markdown or HTML
6. **Export Scheduling**: Allow users to schedule regular exports
